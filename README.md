# Migration demo from CLI NED to NETCONF NED

## Overview

This repository demonstrates creating an IOS-XR NETCONF NED using the Cisco NSO service application in the DevNet sandbox and migrating from the NED to the created NETCONF NED.

The target configuration of NETCONF NED is L3VPN addition to SR-MPLS.



## Requirements

An account that has permission to access the Cisco DevNet sandbox.

## Sandbox used in this demo

Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO)

<img src="./images/nso_sandbox.png" width="25%">

## What you do is

1. Connect to the sandbox
2. Change lab network in CML2
3. Apply CLI NED to new lab network
4. Install Cisco YANG Suite
5. Select YANG module to create NETCONF NED
6. Create NETCONF NED
7. Apply NETCONF NED to new lab network
8. Try to configure

## 1. Connect to the sandbox

Connect to Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) referring to [here](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/sandbox/ "Devnet Sandbox Document").

## 2. Change lab network in CML2

In this demo, we will leave the distribution routers and remove the rest of the nodes. Replace the remaining IOS-XE routers with IOS-XR routers, then set up a segment routing MPLS cloud between them and build an L3VPN using BGP VPNv4.

You can build this lab by running cml2.py from DevBox.

Log in to DevBox.

```shell
$ ssh -l developer 10.10.20.50
developer@10.10.20.50's password:
Last login: Tue Jul 14 05:34:45 2020
(py3venv) [developer@devbox ~]$
```

Clone the iosxr-nc-ned repository.

```shell
(py3venv) [developer@devbox ~]$ git clone https://github.com/masanobu48154/iosxr-nc-ned.git
Cloning into 'iosxr-nc-ned'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 18, done.

Unpacking objects: 100% (18/18), done.
(py3venv) [developer@devbox ~]$ 
```

Go to the iosxr-nc-ned directory and set the CML2 username and password as environment variables.

```shell
(py3venv) [developer@devbox ~]$ cd iosxr-nc-ned/
(py3venv) [developer@devbox iosxr-nc-ned]$ export CML_USERNAME={ CML USERNAME }
(py3venv) [developer@devbox iosxr-nc-ned]$ export CML_PASSWORD={ CML PASSWORD }
```

Run cml2.py.

```shell
(py3venv) [developer@devbox iosxr-nc-ned]$ python3 cml2.py
```

Go to https://10.10.20.161 and log in to CML to verify that nso_lob has been imported.

## 3. Apply CLI NED to new lab network

In the original lab network, dist-rtr01 and dist-rtr02 had IOS CLI NED applied, so change them to IOS-XR CLI NED to match the new lab network.

Log in to NSO/NCS Host.

```shell
$ ssh -l developer 10.10.20.49
developer@10.10.20.49's password:
Last login: Tue Jan 10 17:35:21 2023 from 192.168.254.13
[developer@nso ~]$
```

Go to NSO CLI shell mode.

```shell
[developer@nso ~]$ ncs_cli -C -u developer

User developer last logged in 2023-01-10T14:38:18.25607-08:00, to nso, from 10.10.20.49 using rest-https
developer connected from 192.168.254.13 using ssh on nso
developer@ncs#
```

Check the NED of dist-rtr01.

```shell
developer@ncs# show running-config devices device dist-rtr01 | include ned-id
 device-type cli ned-id cisco-ios-cli-6.67
developer@ncs#
```

Attempting to sync dist-rtr config to NSO fails. This is because IOS-XE has been replaced by IOS-XR in the new lab network.

```shell
developer@ncs# devices device dist-rtr01 sync-from
result false
info Failed to connect to device dist-rtr01: connection refused: Failed to setup NED :: Unknown device ::

sync `dist-rtr-01` config to NSO.

```shell
developer@ncs(config-device-dist-rtr01)# top
developer@ncs(config)# devices device dist-rtr01 sync-from
result true
developer@ncs(config)#
```

`dist-rtr-02` to the new NED as well. And check the running-config with `show running-config devices device { DEVICE } config `.

## 4. Install Cisco YANG Suite

Before building NED with NSO, let's install the very cool [Cisco YANG Suite](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/yangsuite "Cisco YANG Suite") in DevBox to select the YANG modules we need.

Log in to DevBox.

```shell
[masanobu@ccie-pro:~]
$ ssh -l developer 10.10.20.50
developer@10.10.20.50's password:
Last login: Tue Jul 14 05:34:45 2020
(py3venv) [developer@devbox ~]$
```

Clone the yangsuite repository.

```shell
(py3venv) [developer@devbox ~]$ git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/yangsuite
Cloning into 'yangsuite'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 847, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (52/52), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (37/37), done.
remote: Total 847 (delta 26), reused 27 (delta 15), pack-reused 795
Receiving objects: 100% (847/847), 44.85 MiB | 26.44 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (352/352), done.
(py3venv) [developer@devbox ~]$
```

Go to the yangsuite/docker directory and replace `localhost` in each configuration file with `10.10.20.50`.

```shell
(py3venv) [developer@devbox ~]$ cd yangsuite/docker/
(py3venv) [developer@devbox docker]$ sed -i s/localhost/10.10.20.50/g start_yang_suite.sh
(py3venv) [developer@devbox docker]$ sed -i s/localhost/10.10.20.50/g ./nginx/nginx.conf
(py3venv) [developer@devbox docker]$ sed -i s/localhost/10.10.20.50/g ./yangsuite/Dockerfile
(py3venv) [developer@devbox docker]$ sed -i s/localhost/10.10.20.50/g ./yangsuite/production.py
(py3venv) [developer@devbox docker]$ 
```

Running start_yang_suite.sh will ask to set theã€€username, password, email address, and certificate details. The output will look similar to the below

```shell
(py3venv) [developer@devbox docker]$ bash ./start_yang_suite.sh
Hello, please setup YANG Suite admin user.

When YANG Suite is ready to use, it will be displayed as below.

```shell
yangsuite_1  | spawned uWSGI master process (pid: 53)
yangsuite_1  | spawned uWSGI worker 1 (pid: 62, cores: 1)
yangsuite_1  | spawned uWSGI worker 2 (pid: 63, cores: 1)
yangsuite_1  | spawned uWSGI worker 3 (pid: 64, cores: 1)
yangsuite_1  | spawned uWSGI worker 4 (pid: 65, cores: 1)
yangsuite_1  | spawned uWSGI worker 5 (pid: 66, cores: 1)
```

Now you can access the YANG Suite at http://10.10.20.50

## 5. Select YANG module to create NETCONF NED

Since the target configuration of NETCONF NED is adding L3VPN to SR-MPLS, the necessary YANG modules can be expected to be VRF, INTERFACE, and BGP.You can use YANG Suite to select the modules we need.

#### Create New Device Profile

Create a profile for your device to download and try YANG modules.

Log in to Cisco YANG Suite with the username and password you specified when installing, and register `General Info` and `NETCONF`of dist-rtr01 from `Device profiles`.

__Setup__ => __Device profiles__ => __Create new device__ 

define "General Info".

<img src="./images/ys004_device_profile_02.png" width="75%">

Also define "NETCONF" as below.

<img src="./images/ys005_device_profile_03.png" width="75%">

Click "Check connectivity".

<img src="./images/ys006_device_profile_04.png" width="75%">

#### Create New Repositry

Create a `New repository` from `YANG files and repositories` and download all YANG modules from dist-rtr01.

__Setup__ => __Device profiles__ => __Create new device__ 



Now, let's create a VRF YANG module set to get the VRF configuration from the device and set the VRF to the device.
